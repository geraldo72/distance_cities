Distance:
The formula to calculate the distance between two coordinates (latitude / longitude) is the Vincenty's formulae .
It was selected because it has a higher precision due to calculation was based on ellipsoid, which is the geometric shape of the earth and not an sphere which is used on Great-Circle formula.

Combination:
The combination of method used was simple permutation, because the distance between the city A - B is the same as B - A.
In the code, i get a list with all cities inserted in the database and for each city I make a new list containing only the cities that have not yet been iterated.

System:
The system provides two REST webservices:
 cities - Service for CRUD operations on City element
 
 - GET /distance_cities/rest/cities
   Returns a list with all cities inserted on database.
 
 - POST /distance_cities/rest/cities
   Includes the city sent as json. Ex:
   {
        "name": "Barueri",
        "latitude": -23.505776,
        "longitude": -46.838008
    }
 
 - GET /distance_cities/rest/cities/1
   Returns the city with id 1
 
 - PUT /distance_cities/rest/cities/1
   Update the city with id 1 with the data sent as json
 
 - DELETE /distance_cities/rest/cities/1 
   Delete city with id 1
 
 distance - Service for get distance between two cities
 
 - GET /distance_cities/rest/distance?returnType=[xml/json]&measureUnit=[km/mi]
   Returns a list with all combinations with all cities registered and the distance between two of each
   Two mandatory parameters, case insentive:
   		returnType - Type of response - Valid values: xml,json
   		measureUnit - Measure unit used for distance - Valid values: km/mi
 
 - GET /distance_cities/rest/distance/1?returnType=[xml/json]&measureUnit=[km/mi]
   Returns a list with distance between the city with id 1 and all other cities registered
   Two mandatory parameters, case insentive:
   		returnType - Type of response - Valid values: xml,json
   		measureUnit - Measure unit used for distance - Valid values: km/mi
    
   		
 - GET /distance_cities/rest/distance/1/2?returnType=[xml/json]&measureUnit=[km/mi]
   Returns the distance between city with id 1 and city with id 2
   Two mandatory parameters, case insentive:
   		returnType - Type of response - Valid values: xml,json
   		measureUnit - Measure unit used for distance - Valid values: km/mi
